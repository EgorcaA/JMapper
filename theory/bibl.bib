	abstract = {An approach to compute exchange parameters of the Heisenberg model in plane-wave-based methods is presented. This calculation scheme is based on the Green's function method and Wannier function projection technique. It was implemented in the framework of the pseudopotential method and tested on such materials as NiO, FeO, Li2MnO3, and KCuF3. The obtained exchange constants are in a good agreement with both the total energy calculations and experimental estimations for NiO and KCuF3. In the case of FeO our calculations explain the pressure dependence of the N{\textbackslash}'eel temperature. Li2MnO3 turns out to be a Slater insulator with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange defined by the spin splitting. The proposed approach provides a unique way to analyze magnetic interactions, since it allows one to calculate orbital contributions to the total exchange coupling and study the mechanism of the exchange coupling.},

Here, we show that ferromagnetism can hold above 300 K in a metallic phase of 1T-CrTe2 down to the ultra-thin limit. It thus makes CrTe2 so far the only known exfoliated ultra-thin vdW magnets with intrinsic long-range magnetic ordering above room temperature. An in-plane room-temperature negative anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) was obtained in ultra-thin CrTe2 devices, with a sign change in the AMR at lower temperature, with-0.6\% and +5\% at 300 and 10 K, respectively. Our findings provide insights into magnetism in ultra-thin CrTe2, expanding the vdW crystals toolbox for future room-temperature spintronic applications.},

              Intrinsic antiferromagnetism in van der Waals (vdW) monolayer (ML) crystals enriches our understanding of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic orders and presents several advantages over ferromagnetism in spintronic applications. However, studies of 2D intrinsic antiferromagnetism are sparse, owing to the lack of net magnetisation. Here, by combining spin-polarised scanning tunnelling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we investigate the magnetism of vdW ML CrTe
              2
              , which has been successfully grown through molecular-beam epitaxy. We observe a stable antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at the atomic scale in the ML crystal, whose bulk is ferromagnetic, and correlate its imaged zigzag spin texture with the atomic lattice structure. The AFM order exhibits an intriguing noncollinear spin reorientation under magnetic fields, consistent with its calculated moderate magnetic anisotropy. The findings of this study demonstrate the intricacy of 2D vdW magnetic materials and pave the way for their in-depth analysis.},

Recently, a new 2D ferromagnet CrTe2, prepared by mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition, has gained interest due to its novel magnetic properties. In this work, high quality CrTe2 epitaxial thin films were prepared on GaAs (111)B substrates using solid source molecular beam epitaxy, with the thickness varying from 35 to 4 monolayers (MLs). The magnetic easy axis of all the films is oriented along the c-axis. A Curie temperature of 205 K is found in the 35 ML CrTe2 film, measured by the temperature-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (RAHE). Importantly, even when the film thickness decreases to 4 MLs, a robust out-of-plane ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of 191 K has been demonstrated. This finding could pave the way for investigating the fundamental studies in 2D ferromagnetism and has great significance in device applications.},

	abstract = {While the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets opens the door for fundamental physics and next-generation spintronics, it is technically challenging to achieve the room-temperature ferromagnetic (FM) order in a way compatible with potential device applications. Here, we report the growth and properties of single- and few-layer CrTe2, a van der Waals (vdW) material, on bilayer graphene by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Intrinsic ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature (TC) up to 300 K, an atomic magnetic moment of {\textasciitilde}0.21 μB/Cr and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) constant (Ku) of 4.89 × 105 erg/cm3 at room temperature in these few-monolayer films have been unambiguously evidenced by superconducting quantum interference device and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. This intrinsic ferromagnetism has also been identified by the splitting of majority and minority band dispersions with {\textasciitilde}0.2 eV at Г point using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The FM order is preserved with the film thickness down to a monolayer (TC {\textasciitilde} 200 K), benefiting from the strong PMA and weak interlayer coupling. The successful MBE growth of 2D FM CrTe2 films with room-temperature ferromagnetism opens a new avenue for developing large-scale 2D magnet-based spintronics devices. The emergence of two dimensional ferromagnetism suffers from an inherent fragility to thermal fluctuations, which typically restricts the Curie temperature to below room temperature. Here, Zhang et al present CrTe2 thin films grown via molecular beam epitaxy with a Curie temperature exceeding 300 K.},

	abstract = {Graphene is very popular because of its many fascinating properties, but its lack of an electronic bandgap has stimulated the search for 2D materials with semiconducting character. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which are semiconductors of the type MX2, where M is a transition metal atom (such as Mo or W) and X is a chalcogen atom (such as S, Se or Te), provide a promising alternative. Because of its robustness, MoS2 is the most studied material in this family. TMDCs exhibit a unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, strong spin–orbit coupling and favourable electronic and mechanical properties, which make them interesting for fundamental studies and for applications in high-end electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, energy harvesting, flexible electronics, DNA sequencing and personalized medicine. In this Review, the methods used to synthesize TMDCs are examined and their properties are discussed, with particular attention to their charge density wave, superconductive and topological phases. The use of TMCDs in nanoelectronic devices is also explored, along with strategies to improve charge carrier mobility, high frequency operation and the use of strain engineering to tailor their properties.},

	abstract = {Ferromagnets with a Curie temperature surpassing room temperature (RT) are highly sought after for advancing planar spintronics. The ultrathin CrTe2 is proposed as a promising two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet with a Curie temperature above 300 K. However, its single-layer film is highly susceptible to specific external perturbations, leading to variable magnetic features depending on the environment. The magnetic ordering of single-layer CrTe2 remains a topic of debate, and experimental confirmation of ferromagnetic order at RT is still pending. In our study, we utilized molecular beam epitaxy to create a single-layer 1T-CrTe2 on bilayer graphene, demonstrating ferromagnetism above 300 K with in-plane magnetization through superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) measurements. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the ferromagnetic properties stem from epitaxial strain, which increases the distance between adjacent Cr atoms within the layer by about 1.6\% and enhances the Cr–Te–Cr angle by approximately 1.6°. Due to its interaction with the graphene substrate, the magnetic moment transitions from an out-of-plane to an in-plane orientation, while electronic doping exceeds 1.5 e/u.c. Combining DFT calculations with in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterizations allowed us to determine the configuration of the CrTe2 single layer on graphene. This discovery presents the first experimental proof of ferromagnetic order in single-layer CrTe2 with a Curie temperature above RT, laying the groundwork for future applications of CrTe2 single-layer-based spintronic devices.},

Is it possible to indirectly obtain ferromagnetic semiconductors that work at room temperature from the available antiferromagnetic metal through quantum state regulation? Here we employ the density functional theory to systematically investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of the 1T-CrTe2 monolayer under Li atomic adsorption. The 1T-CrTe2 monolayer is an antiferromagnetic metal, which is not suitable for semiconductor spintronic device applications. Interestingly, a desired room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity, i.e., the LiCrTe2 monolayer, is achieved successfully after one Li atomic layer is adsorbed at the 1T-CrTe2 surface. The Curie temperature is above room temperature and reaches 392 K, which remains above room temperature and increases with the increase of in-plane biaxial tensile strain. A semiconductor-to-metal conversion and a change of the orientation of the easy magnetization axis can be realized with robust room-temperature ferromagnetism through electrostatic doping. Our results indicate that the atomic adsorption is an effective strategy to achieve van der Waals room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors.},

In this work, with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we provide the first experimental report on high-quality Bi(110)/CrTe2 magnetic heterostructure. By employing in-situ high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we are able to examine the interaction between magnetism and topology.

	abstract = {Magnetic units with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and high Curie temperature (Tc) are crucial for spintronic and quantum computing devices, which are a persisting demand for miniaturization of magnetic units. Using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulation, it is found that monolayer 1T-CrTe2 exhibits strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with a MAE of approximately 5.29 meV and high Tc of ∼136 K. Interestingly, we find that the MAE and Tc of monolayer 1T-CrTe2 are tunable through electron/hole doping, strain, and heterostructure engineering. The magnetic easy-axis can be adjusted from out of plane to in plane, which is mainly attributed to the coupling between Te atomic orbitals (    p  x ,     p  y). Second-order perturbation theory reveals that the spin–orbit coupling interaction between the occupied     p  x and unoccupied     p  y orbitals in opposite spin channel near Fermi level gives rise to negative contribution of MAE. Moreover, Tc can be enhanced to ∼230 K through super–superexchange mechanism of heterostructure due to the electron hopping between       t  2 g / e  g orbitals of Cr4+ ions and     e  1 /   a  1 orbitals of Fe2+ ions. Importantly, we find that Tc can be boosted above room temperature by applying moderate strain (6\%), ascribing to significant enhancement of MAE and exchange coupling constant. The present work indicates that monolayer 1T-CrTe2-based two-dimensional materials are very promising for room temperature application in magnetic storage and information processing.},

Benefiting from the uniform surface energy of the dangling bond-free Al2O3(0001) surface, the layer-by-layer vdW growth mode is observed right from the initial growth stage, which warrants precise control of the sample thickness beyond three monolayer and homogeneous surface morphology across the entire wafer. Moreover, the presence of the Coulomb interaction at the CrTe2/Al2O3 interface plays an important role in tailoring the anomalous Hall response, and the structural optimization of the CrTe2-based spin-orbit torque device leads to a substantial switching power reduction by 54\%.

The seeking of robust 2D ferromagnets with high Curie temperature (Tc) is vitally important for next-generation spintronic devices. However, owing to the enhanced spin fluctuation and weak exchange interaction upon the reduced dimensionalities, the exploring of robust 2D ferromagnets with Tc {\textgreater} 300 K is highly demanded but remains challenging. In this work, we fabricated air-stable 2D Cr5Te8/CrTe2 vertical heterojunctions with Tc above 400 K by the chemical vapor deposition method. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates a high-quality-crystalline epitaxial structure between tri-Cr5Te8 and 1T-CrTe2 with striped moiré patterns and a superior ambient stability over six months. A built-in dual-axis strain together with strong interfacial coupling cooperatively leads to a record-high Tc for the CrxTey family. A temperature-dependent spin-flip process induces the easy axis of magnetization to rotate from the out-of-plane to the in-plane direction, indicating a phase-dependent proximity coupling effect, rationally interpreted by first-principles calculations of the magnetic anisotropy of a tri-Cr5Te8 and 1T-CrTe2 monolayer. Our results provide a material realization of effectively enhancing the transition temperature of 2D ferromagnetism and manipulating the spin-flip of the easy axis, which will facilitate future spintronic applications.},

Our results indicate that the magnetic order of ML 1⁢𝑇−Cr⁢Te2 can vary among ferromagnets and antiferromagnets with strain and electronic correlation.

The perplexing dependencies of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy on strain and 𝑈 are then well explained.

In this paper, we reported the growth of 2D CrTe2 single-crystal films epitaxially on Al2O3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. We find that it shows a typical paramagnetic–ferromagnetic (PM–FM) phase transition around 200 K. The precise Curie temperature and Weiss temperature are 189 and 206.7 K, respectively. The saturation magnetization reaches 73.64 emu/g for the film thickness of 30 nm. The critical exponent β = 0.329 indicates that the magnetic interactions obey the 3D-Ising model. Electronic transport measurement confirms that a CrTe2 film always remains a metallic behavior at 5 K ≤ T ≤ 320 K and the resistivity of room temperature is 1.5 mΩ/cm. The first-principles calculation uncovers that the FM ordering state mainly stems from an exchange coupling of the adjacent Cr-spin t2g polarized electrons and the metallic conductivity is due to p–d orbital hybridization between Cr and Te atoms.

The formation energies of the different possible structural phases (1T, 1H, 2H) calculated from density functional theory (DFT) show that the 1T phase is the ground state, and the energetic transition barriers between the phases, calculated by the nudged elastic band method, are large, on the order of 0.5 eV. The self-consistent Hubbard 𝑈 correction parameters are calculated for all the phases of CrTe2. The calculated magnetic moment of 1T-CrTe2 with ≥2 layers lies in the plane, whereas the magnetic moment of a monolayer is out-of-plane. Band filling and tensile biaxial strain cause the magnetic moment of a monolayer to switch from out-of-plane to in-plane, and compressive biaxial strain in a bilayer causes the magnetic moment to switch from in-plane to out-of-plane. The magnetic anisotropy is shown to originate from the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the Te atoms and the anisotropy of the exchange coupling constants 𝐽𝑥⁢𝑦 and 𝐽𝑧 in an XXZ type Hamiltonian.

However, whether the ferromagnetism therein can be maintained when continuously reducing the nanosheet’s thickness to monolayer limit remains unknown. Here, through first-principles calculations, we explore the evolution of magnetic properties of 1 to 6 layer CrTe2 nanosheets and several interesting points are found: First, unexpectedly, monolayer CrTe2 prefers a zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) state with its energy much lower than that of FM state. Second, in 2 to 4 layer CrTe2, both the intralayer and interlayer magnetic coupling are AFM. Last, when the number of layers is equal to or greater than 5, the intralayer and interlayer magnetic coupling become FM.

We find that the spin prefers an in-plane direction by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy calculations. The MOE, AHE, and ANE display a period of 2⁢𝜋/3 when the spin rotates within the atomic plane, and they are forbidden if a mirror plane perpendicular to the spin direction exists. By reorienting the spin from the in-plane to out-of-plane direction, the MOE, AHE, and ANE are enhanced by around one order of magnitude. Moreover, we establish the layer-dependent magnetic properties of multilayer 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2 and predict antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism for bilayer and trilayer 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2, respectively. The MOE, AHE, and ANE are prohibited in antiferromagnetic bilayer 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2 due to the existence of the space-time inversion symmetry, whereas all of them are activated in ferromagnetic trilayer 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2 and are significantly enhanced compared to those of monolayer 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2. Our results show that the magneto-optical and anomalous transports proprieties of 1⁢𝑇−CrTe2 can be effectively modulated by altering spin direction and layer number.},

	abstract = {Mismatched lattice constants at a van der Waals epitaxy interface often introduce in-plane strains to the lattice of the epitaxial layer, termed epitaxy strain, wherein the strains do not follow the intralayer Poisson's relation. In this study, we obtained the magnetic phase diagrams of CrSe2 and CrTe2 mono- and bilayers under epitaxy strain up to 8\%, as predicted using density functional theory calculations. The magnetic phase diagrams indicate that the in-plane epitaxy strain manipulates either the intra- or interlayer magnetism. The in-plane strain varies the interlayer distance, defined using an interlayer Poisson's ratio, which determines whether the interlayer magnetism follows a Bethe–Slater curve-like (BSC-like) or a reversed BSC-like behavior, depending on the in-plane magnetism. The tunability of the intralayer magnetism is a result of competing intralayer Cr–Cr superexchange interactions. A graphene substrate was introduced to examine the validity of our diagrams in practice. This study also afforded a tentative explanation on the previously reported magnetizations in CrSe2 and CrTe2 epitaxial mono- or bilayers under epitaxy strains, which had given rise to some controversy.},

	abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order in the single-layer limit. Based on ab initio calculations, we report the emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) phase in monolayer 1T–CrTe2. We demonstrate that this phase is the ground state in the single-layer limit at any strain value. We obtain an optical phonon mode of 1.96 THz that connects the CDW phase with the undistorted 1T phase. Localization of the a1g orbital of CrTe2 produces an out-of-plane orientation of the magnetic moments, circumventing the restrictions of the Mermin–Wagner theorem and producing ferromagnetic long-range order in the two-dimensional limit. This orbital localization is enhanced by the CDW phase. Tensile strain also increases the localization of this orbital, driving the system to become ordered. CrTe2 becomes an example of a material where the CDW phase produces the stabilization of the long-range ferromagnetic order. Our results show that both strain and phase switching are mechanisms to control the 2D ferromagnetic order of CrTe2.},

	abstract = {The discovery of ferromagnetic two-dimensional van der Waals materials has opened up opportunities to explore intriguing physics and to develop innovative spintronic devices. However, controllable synthesis of these 2D ferromagnets and enhancing their stability under ambient conditions remain challenging. Here, we report chemical vapor deposition growth of air-stable 2D metallic 1T-CrTe2 ultrathin crystals with controlled thickness. Their long-range ferromagnetic ordering is confirmed by a robust anomalous Hall effect, which has seldom been observed in other layered 2D materials grown by chemical vapor deposition. With reducing the thickness of 1T-CrTe2 from tens of nanometers to several nanometers, the easy axis changes from in-plane to out-of-plane. Monotonic increase of Curie temperature with the thickness decreasing from {\textasciitilde}130.0 to {\textasciitilde}7.6 nm is observed. Theoretical calculations indicate that the weakening of the Coulomb screening in the two-dimensional limit plays a crucial role in the change of magnetic properties.},

	abstract = {Magnetic anisotropy is an important characteristic of magnetic materials. Particularly, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is superior for the design of spintronic devices, with the advantages of scalability, endurance, thermal stability, and low switching current density. Although a series of two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D layered ferromagnets have been demonstrated, the room temperature intrinsic ferromagnets with PMA is rarely found. Here, we report PMA in a room-temperature layered ferromagnet of Cr-intercalated CrTe2. By self-intercalation of the native Cr atoms, the in-plane anisotropy of CrTe2 can be switched to PMA. Meanwhile, the Cr-intercalated CrTe2 crystal can be easily exfoliated into thin flakes with thickness ∼10 nm. Besides the robust PMA at room temperature, Cr-intercalated CrTe2 also exhibits high saturation magnetization (208 emu cm−3 at 300 K), large anomalous Hall angle (2.23\% at 300 K) and giant anomalous Hall factor (∼0.18 at 300 K). These excellent properties are highly desired for applications, and make Cr-intercalated CrTe2 a distinguished candidate among all existing magnetic materials. Our work reveals a promising platform for spintronic devices and offers a new route for controlling the magnetic anisotropy in layered materials.},
